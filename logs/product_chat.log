2025-04-20 23:30:08,169 - INFO - **Hello Bob! ðŸ“±**

I'd be happy to help you find a good phone! Based on our previous conversation, I noticed you purchased an iPhone 5s mini and an Apple wireless charger. It looks like you might be interested in another iPhone or a similar device.

Considering your previous purchase, I would recommend the **iPhone 14 Pro Max with 256GB storage** ($900). It's a high-end device that would pair well with your existing iPhone and accessories.

If you'd prefer an Android option, our laptop section doesn't seem to have any relevant phones. However, if you're looking for a suggestion, I can offer the **Android phone with 128GB storage** ($600).

Let me know if either of these options interest you, or if you'd like more recommendations! ðŸ˜Š

I'd be happy to help you find a good phone. ðŸ“±

Based on our previous order, we had an Iphone 5s mini (a great all-around device) and an apple wireless charger (which would pair perfectly with your new phone). Considering these options, here are some additional suggestions:

*   **Iphone 14 Pro Max** with 256GB storage: a high-end option with a large screen and great camera capabilities.
*   **Android phone** with 128GB storage: an affordable alternative to the iPhone, offering various customization options.

Which of these sounds appealing to you? ðŸ¤”
